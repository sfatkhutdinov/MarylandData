## Conclusion: Building Community Power

This human-centered improvement plan for Hanover represents a fundamental shift from development that extracts wealth to development that builds community power. Rather than attracting corporations that will exploit our community, we focus on creating the conditions for human flourishing.

**Our vision prioritizes:**
- **People over profit** in every decision
- **Community ownership** over private speculation
- **Universal access** over market-based exclusion
- **Democratic participation** over top-down control
- **Cooperation** over competition
- **Sustainability** over short-term gain

**The transformation we envision:**
- Every resident can walk safely to essential services
- Healthcare is a guaranteed human right, not a commodity
- Housing is community-controlled and permanently affordable
- Essential services are owned and operated by community members
- Environmental health is protected through community control
- Economic development builds community wealth rather than extracting it

This plan provides a roadmap for creating a community that works for everyone, not just those who can afford market-rate services. It recognizes that true community improvement comes from organizing community power, not attracting external investment.

**The choice is clear:** We can continue with development that makes wealthy investors richer while making life harder for working people, or we can build a community controlled by and accountable to the people who live here.

**Hanover has the resources, the diversity, and the strategic position to become a model for human-centered community development. The question is whether we have the political will to choose people over profit.**
