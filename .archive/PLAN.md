# Hanover Community Improvement Plan

**Status:** Data Collection Phase  
**Last Updated:** September 21, 2025  
**Methodology:** Evidence-based analysis with documented data sources

---

## ÔøΩ **CURRENT PHASE: ESTABLISHING DATA FOUNDATION**

**Priority:** Build reliable data collection infrastructure before making community recommendations

### **What We're Doing Now**
- Implementing Census API data collection for ZIP 21076
- Gathering Maryland DOT construction cost benchmarks
- Researching peer-reviewed community impact studies
- Establishing transparent calculation methodologies

### **What We're Not Doing Yet**
- Making infrastructure recommendations without data validation
- Assuming demographic or employment compositions
- Calculating benefits without supporting research
- Proposing funding scenarios without competitive analysis

### **Data Collection Approach**
- **Population & Demographics**: Census Bureau ACS 5-Year estimates (2019-2023)
- **Geographic Boundaries**: ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) for statistical precision
- **Employment Analysis**: Bureau of Labor Statistics occupational and industry data
- **Transportation Patterns**: Census commuting data and local transportation surveys

*All demographic and economic characteristics will be determined through data collection, not assumptions.*

   - Healthcare facility access analysis
   - Recreation and public space connectivity
   - Senior and family service accessibility

### **Evidence Requirements for Each Priority**
- **Need Assessment**: Data-driven analysis of current gaps and usage patterns
- **Cost Analysis**: Maryland DOT comparable project costs with documentation
- **Benefit Calculation**: Peer-reviewed research with appropriate effect sizes
- **Implementation Timeline**: Realistic funding scenarios based on grant success rates
   - Healthcare access assessment
   - Community space development
   - Emergency services optimization

### **Economic Development**
1. **Local Business Support**

## üìä **METHODOLOGY PRINCIPLES**

### **Data Standards**
- All demographic claims sourced from official government datasets
- Cost estimates based on recent comparable projects
- Benefit calculations grounded in peer-reviewed research
- Uncertainty ranges provided for all projections

### **Analysis Approach**
- Conservative benefit estimates with sensitivity analysis
- Multiple funding scenarios with realistic success probabilities
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- External validation using comparable communities

### **Transparency Requirements**
- All data sources documented with collection dates
- Calculation methodology fully reproducible
- Assumptions clearly stated and justified
- Limitations explicitly acknowledged

---

## üí∞ **PRELIMINARY COST FRAMEWORK**

### **Infrastructure Estimates** *(Under Review)*
- Sidewalk completion: [Research in progress - Maryland DOT data]
- Intersection improvements: [Research in progress - comparable projects]
- Community facilities: [Research in progress - HRSA standards]

### **Funding Strategy Development**
- Federal grant program competitive analysis
- County capital budget process research
- State program eligibility assessment
- Community fundraising capacity evaluation

*Note: Previous analysis claimed unrealistic 90% external funding. New analysis will develop multiple scenarios based on actual grant success rates and local match requirements.*

   - Mode shift potential analysis
   - Realistic savings calculations based on usage patterns

3. **Health Outcomes**
   - Community health needs assessment
   - Healthcare access and utilization studies
   - Evidence-based benefit projections

### **Community Benefits**
1. **Safety Improvements**
   - Pedestrian accident reduction studies
   - Emergency response time analysis
   - Community policing enhancement

2. **Quality of Life**
