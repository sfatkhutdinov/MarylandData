# Maryland’s workforce declined by 3,200 jobs in August 2025

Loss includes 2,500 federal government jobs

BALTIMORE, MD (September 19, 2025) – Maryland’s workforce decreased by 3,200 jobs in August, according to new estimates released today by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). This decrease in jobs was due to a reported decline of 2,000 private sector jobs and a decline of 1,200 public sector jobs.

Driving that public sector decrease was a loss of another 2,500 federal jobs in August, tempered by slight increases in state and local public sector jobs. Including August’s decline, Maryland has lost 15,100 federal jobs since January 2025.

BLS reported that Maryland’s unemployment rate increased from 3.4 percent to 3.6 percent in August. August’s reported unemployment rate is lower than the national rate (3.6 percent vs 4.3 percent).

The five sectors with the largest employment gains in August were: Construction (2,700 jobs); Accommodation and Food Services (1,400 jobs); Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services (600 jobs); Private Educational Services (500); and Real Estate and Rental and Leasing (300 jobs).
