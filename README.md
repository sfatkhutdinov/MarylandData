## MCP-Enhanced Analysis Framework

This project leverages Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for real-time data verification:

**MCP Servers Used:**
- **Wikipedia**: Baseline demographic verification
- **Maryland OpenGov**: State transportation and housing data
- **Web Search**: Current development and policy updates
- **Memory**: Knowledge graph for research tracking
- **Sequential Thinking**: Complex analytical workflows

**Configuration:** See `.mcp.json` for server setup and usage patterns documented in `CLAUDE.md`

  ## Verified Data Ingestion (No-Hallucination)

  To incorporate current economic context (e.g., Aug 2025 federal job losses) without speculation:

  1) Ingest official release into the repo (archived under `data/raw/`):
	  - Source: Maryland Department of Labor news release – August 2025
	  - Saved as: `data/raw/mlraug2025.md` (includes URL and retrieval timestamp)

  2) Parse to structured JSON with provenance:
	  - Run: scripts/ingest_md_labor_release.py
	  - Output: `data/processed/mlraug2025.json` containing highlights and sector changes

  3) Use only persisted sources in analysis/visuals:
	  - `real_hanover_analysis.py` reads processed JSON to produce `data/maryland_jobs_shock_aug2025.png`

  Guardrails:
  - If the raw source file is missing, the ingestion script fails hard.
  - If parsing can’t locate expected phrases, it errors and blocks downstream steps.
  - Charts display source URL and retrieval timestamp for transparency.

  This ensures all post–training-cutoff facts are grounded in archived sources, not model memory.

  ## Runner Guardrails

  The analysis runner (`real_hanover_analysis.py`) enforces fail-fast checks to prevent hallucinations:
  - Required files:
    - `data/hanover_real_data.json`
    - `data/real_employment_income.json`
    - `data/raw/mlraug2025.md`
    - `data/processed/mlraug2025.json`
  - If any are missing, the script prints which files are missing and exits with a non-zero code.
  - How to fix: run `python scripts/ingest_md_labor_release.py` (after activating your virtualenv) to populate the MD Labor artifacts.

  Outputs include:
  - `data/maryland_jobs_shock_aug2025.png` visualizing the verified statewide jobs and federal losses context.

  Together with the ingestion step, this guarantees analysis stays tied to persisted sources and timestamps.

## Provenance Audit (Trust, but verify)

If you want a one-command proof that this repo’s numbers aren’t hallucinated, run the provenance audit. It:
- Verifies outputs are traceable to raw cached API responses (with endpoint, variables, geography, timestamps)
- Cross-checks key metrics against raw values (population, vacancy, price-to-income)
- Scans for misplaced or duplicate raw files and suggests cleanup
- Produces a report at `data/provenance_audit_report.md`

Try it:

```
python scripts/audit_provenance.py
```

Interpretation:
- Overall: PASS — provenance links and metric cross-checks are consistent
- WARN/FAIL — missing provenance or mismatches; the report explains exactly what to fix

The audit verifies that both ACS/Decennial baseline and the income/employment ingestions cache their raw Census API arrays under data/raw/census with attached provenance (endpoint, variables, geography, timestamps). If any referenced raw files are missing, it will flag them.
