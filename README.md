# Hanover Community Analysis - Data-Driven Infrastructure Planning

Evidence-based analysis of community improvement opportunities for Hanover, MD (ZIP 21076) using rigorous methodology and real government data sources.

## ðŸš¨ Project Status: Methodological Rebuild

**Current Phase:** Data collection infrastructure development  
**Priority:** Establish reliable data pipelines before analysis

The original analysis contained fundamental methodological flaws and has been archived. All new work follows strict data integrity standards documented in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

## ï¿½ Core Principles

- **Data-First**: Census API, BLS, and state data sources only - no hardcoded values
- **Geographic Precision**: ZIP code 21076-specific analysis, not county averages  
- **Transparent Methodology**: All assumptions documented with uncertainty ranges
- **Community-Centered**: Serve all residents regardless of employment sector

## ðŸŽ¯ Development Priorities

### Phase 1: Data Foundation (Current)
1. **Census API Implementation** - ZIP 21076 demographics and housing data
2. **Employment Data Collection** - BLS occupational and industry statistics  
3. **Transportation Patterns** - Commuting and mobility analysis
4. **Infrastructure Costs** - Maryland DOT construction benchmarks

### Phase 2: Analysis Infrastructure  
1. **Literature Review** - Peer-reviewed community impact studies
2. **Statistical Framework** - Uncertainty quantification and validation
3. **Visualization Standards** - Professional charts with source attribution
