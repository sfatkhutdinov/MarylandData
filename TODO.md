## üìä **METHODOLOGY VALIDATION** *(Weeks 3-4)*

#### **Literature Review Foundation**
- [ ] **HIGH:** Review peer-reviewed walkability impact studies  
- [ ] **HIGH:** Research healthcare cost methodologies for community centers
- [ ] **MEDIUM:** Analyze property value studies with appropriate controls
- [ ] **LOW:** Document all research sources with effect sizes and limitations

#### **Analysis Standards**
- [ ] **HIGH:** Create uncertainty quantification templates
- [ ] **HIGH:** Establish visualization standards with source attribution
- [ ] **MEDIUM:** Develop conservative estimation guidelines
- [ ] **LOW:** Create peer review checklist for all analyses
---

## üöÄ **IMPLEMENTATION READINESS** *(Weeks 5-6)*

#### **Community Analysis Pipeline**
- [ ] **HIGH:** Create demographic analysis workflow without employment assumptions
- [ ] **HIGH:** Develop transportation pattern analysis from Census commuting data  
- [ ] **MEDIUM:** Build comparative analysis framework (ZIP vs County vs State)
- [ ] **LOW:** Create automated reporting with uncertainty indicators

#### **Funding & Implementation Research**  
- [ ] **HIGH:** Analyze federal grant programs (RAISE, SS4A) with success rates
- [ ] **HIGH:** Research state and county funding mechanisms
- [ ] **MEDIUM:** Calculate realistic local match requirements
- [ ] **LOW:** Create tiered implementation scenarios

---

## üìã **ONGOING QUALITY ASSURANCE**

#### **Methodological Standards**
- [ ] **Always verify:** All data points have documented sources and collection dates
- [ ] **Always include:** Uncertainty ranges and margin of error for estimates  
- [ ] **Always document:** All assumptions and limitations in analysis
- [ ] **Always validate:** Employment claims with comprehensive BLS data

#### **Community-Centered Approach**
- [ ] **Never assume:** Demographics without Census validation
- [ ] **Never prioritize:** One employment sector over community-wide needs
- [ ] **Never fabricate:** Benefits without peer-reviewed research backing
- [ ] **Never claim:** Funding scenarios without competitive analysis
